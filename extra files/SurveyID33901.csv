I could not tell the difference between the three visualizations of 'changes through time'. The first and last look the same and I don't know what changes in the second one, the caption is not clear.

In the dashboard, sometimes the texts get hidden by the visuals.

Also, some labels are partially hidden (dashboard, technical). I know the measure names are available, but I realized that late

It is better to separate population numbers by comma to read them easily ex. 1,999,999
